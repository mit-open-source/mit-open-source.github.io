<p>
Today we invited guest speaker Keir Mierle to tell us about a cool open source 3D 
animation software called <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>. 
The software supports the entirety of the 3D animation pipeline, and can also 
serve as a video editor and game engine.
Keir specifically worked on Blender's motion tracking algorithm. He walked us 
through a demo of tracking points in a room to learn the video camera's motion, 
and add new elements to the room.
