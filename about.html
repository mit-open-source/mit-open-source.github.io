<p>At MIT Open Source Club (MITOS), our goal to connect students with other students, industry professionals, and professors who are currently working on open source projects. We believe students can gain valuable experience contributing to projects of their choosing while giving back to the open source community!</p>

<p>If you are an open source contributor who would like to share a project, or a student who would like to get involved, contact us at <a href="mailto:mitos-exec@mit.edu" target="_top">mitos-exec@mit.edu</a>.</p>
