    <h3>How is MITOS affiliated with MIT?</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            MITOS is a subcommittee of the <a
              href="http://ieee.scripts.mit.edu/">MIT ACM/IEEE Club</a>.  This
            is the MIT student branch of two international organizations, the
            Association for Computing Machinery and Institute of Electrical and
            Electronics Engineers.

    <h3>How can I get involved with MITOS as a student?</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
          First, contact us at <a
            href="mailto:mitos-exec@mit.edu">mitos-exec@mit.edu</a> so we can
          add you to our mailing list! We’ll notify members via email before
          our meetings with the agenda for the week. Activities will vary by
          week, and include panels, open-source project presentations, student
          speakers, and student work time. Feel free to drop by any week for
          free food, project inspiration, and student support!
        </p>
        <p>
            Meeting with guest speakers are recorded and put up on our Youtube channel
            in case you aren’t able to attend.

    <h3>Can I present my open source project to MITOS?</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
          Of course! One of our main goals is to connect project owners and
          contributors with students. Contact us at <a
          href="mailto:mitox-exec@mit.edu">mitos-exec@mit.edu</a> and we’ll try
        to get something set up!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are remote, please note that at this point, we prefer
            in-person presentations for active student participation. However,
            if you let us know when you’ll be in the area, we will work around
            your schedule.

    <h3>Does MITOS have a stance on open source vs. free software?</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Our primary focus is to help students find projects and provide them support.
            Beyond that, the club remains neutral on open source vs. free software.
            Though individual members may have varied opinions on the subject,
            we are open to all and help anyone who wants to contribute.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, we do think it’s important to be aware of the social
            implications of your work. We encourage discussion, so feel free to
            ask your questions during our meetings!
